About Me

Hi, my name's Farha. I'm a senior at EMU, majoring in Computer Science (Applied). I go by the motto of lifelong learning, and am always intested in a challenge. As Secretary of EMU's Women in Computer Science Organization, I'm passionate about everything that can be accomplished using technology, and am currently working at EMU's Bits and Bytes and Gigabits summer learning programs for middle and high school girls. I am currently open to new opportunities!
